Smell My City Cordova App
============================

A client to interface with the [Smell Pittsburgh](https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/smell-pittsburgh-rails) project (Ruby on Rails) through HTTP requests, and displays the site's smell map visualization using an iframe.

This application was designed using [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/). It uses the [jQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/) Framework for UI elements and browser events.

Note: If you try to build in Android Studio, you may need to click the link in the error message that comes up to "move" the minSdk. Follow the instructions the IDE gives. It can actually be helpful at times. This may (hopefully) become unnecessary after future cordova android platform updates.

Currently used library versions (as of app version 1.1.4):
- cordova: `9.0.0`
- cordova platform android: `8.1.0`
- cordova platform ios: `5.1.1`
