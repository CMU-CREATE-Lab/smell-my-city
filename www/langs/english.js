    p1: "Air quality is usually invisible to us; however, air pollution can have very real, long term impacts on our health and quality of life. Foul odors outside are typically symptoms of a serious pollution problem in our region. We, our children, our friends and families all breathe in this air. If our air smells toxic, then we are likely inhaling toxins.",
    p2: "The Smell MyCity app was designed to crowdsource smell reports so we can track how pollutants travel through our air across our cities. All odor complaints submitted through the app are visible on our map, and smell report data are publicly available through our website. The map view displays smell reports submitted in the area on a given date. This allows residents to track where odors are frequently concentrated, and link those smell events to poor air quality in, or upwind from, those areas. In addition, we are working toward building partnerships with communities across the country to ensure local smell report data are made available to local regulatory agencies, so they can better monitor and act on these complaints.",

    p3: "Smell MyCity was developed by the CMU CREATE Lab, as an extension of their Smell Pittsburgh (Smell PGH) app, which was deployed in 2016 and privileges citizens' concerns about local air pollution issues. Smell PGH has activated local residents, and provided the local health department with a higher resolution of pollution data to help track down potential sources. Given the successful implementation of this smell reporting app in Pittsburgh, the CREATE Lab developed the Smell MyCity app to bring this technology to residents across the U.S. Smell MyCity will be first piloted in Louisville, KY and Portland, OR, in collaboration with local advocacy and community groups. However, the app is available for anyone to use, anywhere in the U.S. The goal of these targeted pilots is to help shape the Smell MyCity app into a more useful tool for communities across the country.",
    p4: "Smell MyCity is supported by Seventh Generation, which is committed to <a href='https://www.seventhgeneration.com/action/climate-justice-equity' target='_blank'>Climate Justice & Equity</a> for the next seven generations. Their efforts on the <a href='https://www.sierraclub.org/ready-for-100' target='_blank'>Ready for 100 Campaign</a> are inspiring cities across the country to switch to 100% renewable energy, to help reduce negative health effects caused by burning fossil fuels. Powered by Seventh Generation's vision and leadership, the Smell MyCity app will be made available to residents across the country, so that we all have an opportunity to join a larger, nation-wide community of citizens actively documenting the human impacts of air pollution.",

They believe that a company's values are as important as the products it makes. Seventh Generation knows that plant-based products can provide the efficacy you are looking for, and that products designed from renewable plant-based ingredients are a more sustainable option than ingredients made from petroleum. Above all, they believe that we have a responsibility to this generation and the next seven, and invite us all on their journey to nurture the health of the next seven generations.",
